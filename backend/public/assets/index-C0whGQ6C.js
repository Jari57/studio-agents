Each agent specializes in a different part of the music creation process. For example, Ghostwriter can help you write lyrics, while Beat Lab can generate drum patterns. Once you\'ve selected an agent, enter a prompt describing what you want to create. You can then save your creation as a new project, which will appear in your Project Hub for later recall.'},{icon:l,title:"Agent Mastery",desc:"Deep dives into each agent's unique capabilities.",details:'Mastering our agents requires understanding their specific strengths.
