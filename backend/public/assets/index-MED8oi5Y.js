I came up from the basement, now I'm touching ceilings
Every scar on my heart, turned into healing
They said I wouldn't make it, look at me now
Stack my paper to the sky, take a bow

**Hook:**
Started from the bottom, now we at the top
Dreams in my pocket, never gonna stop
Every door they closed, I kicked it down
King of my city, wear that crown

**Verse 2:**
Midnight sessions, pouring out my soul
Every word I write is making me whole
They tried to dim my light, but I shine brighter
Every struggle made me a fighter

# Music Copyright 101

## What You Own
When you create an original song, you automatically own the copyright. No registration required (though it helps in court).

### Two Types of Copyright:
1. **Composition Copyright** - The song itself (lyrics + melody)
2. **Sound Recording Copyright** - The specific recording (master)

## Key Rights You Control:
- Reproduction (copies)
- Distribution (selling/streaming)
- Public Performance (radio, venues)
- Derivative Works (remixes, samples)
- Sync (TV, film, ads)

## Best Practices:
- Register with the Copyright Office ($65)
- Keep dated drafts and session files
- Use split sheets before sessions
- Consider publishing admin

## AI-Generated Content:
Currently, AI-generated content without human authorship may not be copyrightable. Always add meaningful human creative input.

# Sync Licensing Guide

## What is Sync?
Synchronization licensing = permission to use music with visual media (TV, film, ads, games, YouTube).

## The Two Licenses You Need:
1. **Sync License** - From the publisher/songwriter (composition)
2. **Master License** - From the label/artist (recording)

If you own both, you can grant both!

## How to Get Placements:

### 1. Music Libraries
- Musicbed, Artlist, Epidemic Sound
- Non-exclusive = keep your rights
- Lower fees but steady income

### 2. Sync Agents
- Pitch to music supervisors for you
- Take 15-50% commission
- Best for quality catalog

### 3. Direct Outreach
- Build relationships with music supervisors
- Attend sync conferences
- Use LinkedIn and industry events

## Pricing Guidelines:
- Student Film: Free - $500
- Indie Film: $1,000 - $10,000
- TV Show: $5,000 - $50,000
- Major Ad Campaign: $50,000 - $500,000+

## Pro Tips:
- Instrumental versions are essential
- Clean versions (no explicit)
- Stems available on request
- Quick turnaround = more placements

# AI & Intellectual Property Rights

## Current Legal Landscape (2026)

### Copyright Office Position:
- Works must have human authorship
- Pure AI output = no copyright
- Human + AI collaboration = copyrightable (human elements)

### Best Practices for AI-Assisted Creation:

1. **Document Your Process**
   - Save prompts and iterations
   - Note your creative decisions
   - Keep before/after versions

2. **Add Meaningful Human Input**
   - Edit AI outputs substantially
   - Use AI as starting point, not final product
   - Combine multiple generations with human curation

3. **Disclosure Considerations**
   - No legal requirement (yet) to disclose AI use
   - Some platforms have policies
   - Industry norms are evolving

## Studio Agents & Your Rights

When you use Studio Agents:
- You own the outputs you create
- We don't claim rights to your work
- You're responsible for ensuring originality
- We recommend human review of all outputs

## Training Data Concerns:
- Some AI models trained on copyrighted works
- Legal challenges ongoing
- Studio Agents uses licensed/permitted training data

## Stay Updated:
AI law is evolving rapidly. This document will be updated as regulations develop.

# Label Deal Breakdown

## Types of Deals

### 1. Traditional Record Deal
- Label owns masters
- Artist gets 12-20% royalty
- Advance recouped from royalties
- Label funds recording, marketing, distribution

### 2. Distribution Deal
- You own masters
- Keep 80-100% of revenue
- Pay distributor fee (15-30%)
- You fund everything

### 3. Licensing Deal
- You own masters
- License to label for set term (3-7 years)
- Higher royalty (50-70%)
- Masters revert to you after term

### 4. Joint Venture (JV)
- Shared ownership (50/50)
- Shared costs and profits
- Best of both worlds
- Requires leverage to negotiate

## Key Terms to Know:

**Advance:** Loan against future royalties (not free money!)
**Recoupment:** Label recoups costs before you see royalties
**Cross-collateralization:** Losses on one album offset gains on another
**Options:** Label's right to your next albums
**360 Deal:** Label takes cut of touring, merch, publishing

## Red Flags:
- Perpetual ownership of masters
- Cross-collateralization across revenue streams
- Excessive option periods
- Vague "commercially reasonable" language

## Negotiation Tips:
- Always have an entertainment lawyer
- Sunset clauses on recoupment
- Audit rights
- Reversion clauses
- Cap on recoupable expenses

# Publishing 101

## What is Music Publishing?
Publishing = the business of your SONGS (not recordings)

When you write a song, you create intellectual property that generates money every time it's:
- Streamed or downloaded (Mechanical)
- Played on radio or in public (Performance)
- Used in TV/Film/Ads (Sync)
- Printed as sheet music (Print)

## The Money Flow

### Performance Royalties
- Collected by PROs (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR)
- Radio, TV, streaming, live venues, bars, stores
- Split: 50% writer / 50% publisher

### Mechanical Royalties
- Paid for reproductions of your song
- Streaming, downloads, CDs
- In US: collected by MLC (Mechanical Licensing Collective)
- Rate: ~$0.0008 per stream

### Sync Fees
- One-time licensing fees
- Negotiated per placement
- You keep 100% (minus admin fees)

## Who Collects What?

| Source | Who Collects |
|--------|--------------|
| US Performance | Your PRO (ASCAP/BMI/SESAC) |
| US Mechanicals | The MLC |
| International | Sub-publishers or admin |
| Sync | Publisher or you directly |

## Getting Started:
1. Join a PRO (free)
2. Register with The MLC
3. Consider a publishing admin (Songtrust, CD Baby Pro)
4. Register every song you write

## Publisher vs Publishing Admin:
- **Publisher:** Takes ownership, active pitching, 50% of publishing
- **Admin:** No ownership, just collection, 10-20% fee

You can then save your creation as a new project, which will appear in your Project Hub for later recall.`},{icon:F,title:"Agent Mastery",desc:"Deep dives into each agent's unique capabilities.",details:`Mastering our agents requires understanding their specific strengths.
