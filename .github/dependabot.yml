# Dependabot will:
# 1. Check for updates weekly on Mondays at 9am
# 2. Group minor/patch updates to reduce PR noise
# 3. Create separate PRs for security updates (always)
# 4. Ignore major version updates (manual review required)
# 5. Limit to 5 open PRs per package ecosystem
# 6. Add appropriate labels for easy filtering
